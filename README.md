# LoRaWAN-dissertation

Communication between IoT devices is a complex issue, especially in the case of battery-powered devices. Therefore, several lightweight wireless communication protocols have been developed that enable the development of devices with a lifetime of several years without needing to replace the battery power source. One of such solutions is the LoRa technology. Therefore, the solution developed under the project should consist of the LoRa gateway built using commodity hardware and dedicated radio modules.
